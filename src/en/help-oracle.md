Title: Using the Oracle cloud

# Using the Oracle public cloud

Juju has built-in support for [Oracle Compute][oracle-compute], Oracle's public
cloud. This means that there is no need to add the Oracle cloud to Juju. An
exception to this is if you have an Oracle Compute trial account. Both types of
accounts, paid and trial, are covered here.

!!! Warning:
    Support for Oracle Compute is new (since Juju 2.2) and some sub-optimal
    traits may still be observed.

This page will cover the following steps:

1. Associate Oracle's Ubuntu images with your Compute service. Juju needs these
   to be able to deploy Ubuntu-based applications.
1. For trial accounts, add the Oracle cloud to Juju.
1. Add credentials to Juju so it can make use of your Oracle Compute account.
1. Create the Juju controller

## Information gathering

The email you received upon signing up for Oracle Compute contains vital
information you will need to complete the instructions presented here. Look
for:

- 'My Services URL'
- 'Identity domain'
- 'My Account URL'
- 'Username' (your email address)
- 'Password' (temporary)

Upon first login (to 'My Services URL') you will be prompted to change the
temporary password to arrive at your final password.

## Ubuntu images

You will need to make Ubuntu images available in your Oracle Compute account in
order for Juju to be able to create Ubuntu-based machines. This is a
requirement.

Proceed as follows:

1. Navigate to 'My Services URL' and log in.
1. Select your 'Identity Domain' in the top-right corner.
1. Click on the 'Create instance' box and then 'Create' a Compute service.

![Create Compute service](../media/oracle_empty-dashboard-2.png)

!!! Recall:
    We are doing this to associate images with your 'identity domain'. We will
    not be creating an instance here.

Click on 'Marketplace' on the resulting page (left menu), enter 'ubuntu' into
the search field, and hit Enter:

![Search Ubuntu images](../media/oracle_create-instance-ubuntu-2.png)

From the point of view of Juju, some images should not be used.
Juju-compatible images are listed below:

| Version          | Arch   | Series  |
|------------------| -------|---------|
| Ubuntu 12.04 LTS | amd64  | Precise |
| Ubuntu 14.04 LTS | amd64  | Trusty  |
| Ubuntu 16.04 LTS | amd64  | Xenial  |
| Ubuntu 17.04     | amd64  | Zesty   |

!!! Warning:
    In particular, Ubuntu 16.10 (Yakkety) should not be used with Juju.

Since Juju uses charms to install applications, the Ubuntu series you need are
those that the charms were written for. If unsure, it is recommended to add the
two most recent LTS releases.

!!! Note:
    At time of writing, Trusty and Xenial are the two most recent Ubuntu
    LTS releases.

Select a compatible image from among the official Ubuntu images (orange Ubuntu
logo), accept Oracle's terms and conditions, and click 'Install'. Repeat the
process for each desired image. These installed images will end up under
'Private Images' in the menu on the left:

![List private images](../media/oracle_create-instance-private-2.png)

## Trial accounts

As mentioned, you will need to add your Oracle cloud to Juju if you're using a
trial account. This requires a 'REST Endpoint'. To get this, navigate to 'My
Account URL', scroll down to 'Oracle Compute Cloud Service', and click on it.
The resulting page will look similar to this:

![REST endpoint](../media/oracle_myservices-endpoint-2.png)

There may be multiple endpoints. In that case, trial and error may be needed
below (hint: the endpoint domain should be resolvable using DNS).

You are now ready to use the interactive `add-cloud` command:

```bash
juju add-cloud
```

Example user session:

```no-highlight
Cloud Types
  maas
  manual
  openstack
  oracle
  vsphere

Select cloud type: oracle

Enter a name for your oracle cloud: oracle-cloud

Enter the API endpoint url for the cloud:
https://compute.uscom-central-1.oraclecloud.com/

Cloud "oracle-cloud" successfully added
You may bootstrap with 'juju bootstrap oracle-cloud'
```

We've called the new cloud 'oracle-cloud' and used an endpoint of
'https://compute.uscom-central-1.oraclecloud.com/'.

Now confirm the successful addition of the cloud:

```bash
juju clouds
```

Here is a partial output:

```no-highlight
Cloud            Regions  Default          Type        Description
.
.
.
oracle                 5  uscom-central-1  oracle      Oracle Compute Cloud Service
oracle-cloud           0                   oracle      Oracle Compute Cloud Service
```

Cloud 'oracle' is for the built-in (for pay) service and cloud 'oracle-cloud'
is tied to your trial account.

## Add credentials

Use the interactive `add-credential` command to add your credentials to your
cloud. Below, we add credentials to the trial account cloud:

```bash
juju add-credential oracle-cloud
```

Here is a resulting example user session:

```no-highlight
Enter credential name: oracle-cloud-creds

Using auth-type "userpass".

Enter username: javierlarin72@gmail.com

Enter password:

Enter identity-domain: a498151

Credentials added for cloud oracle-cloud.
```

We've called the new credential 'oracle-cloud-creds' and entered values for
'Username', 'Password', and 'Identity domain'.

!!! Note:
    The password will not be echoed back to the screen.


## Juju networks and spaces

You can optionally link Oracle Compute IP networks and IP exchanges with Juju's
networks and spaces.

To do this:

1. Navigate to 'My Services URL'.
1. Open the left menu (top-left icon) and select 'Compute'.
1. From the 'Network' tab select 'IP Exchanges' from the menu on the left.
1. Click on the 'Create IP Exchange' button and enter a name for the exchange,
   and optionally, a description and one or more tags.

![Create an IP exchange](../media/oracle_create-ip-exchange-2.png)

Now create a network to use this exchange by selecting 'IP Networks' from the
menu and clicking on 'Create IP Network':

![Create an IP network](../media/oracle_create-ip-network-2.png)

Enter a name, a CIDR formatted address for the 'IP Address Prefix', and an
optional description with one or more tags. Use the 'IP Exchange' drop-down
menu to select the exchange created previously and click on 'Create'.

When you next create a Juju controller (see below), you'll be able to use these
new subnets and spaces. For example, typing `juju subnets` will show output
similar to the following:

```no-highlight
subnets:
  192.168.0.0/16:
    type: ipv4
    provider-id: /Compute-a498151/javierlarin72@gmail.com/oracle-cloud-ip-network
    status: in-use
    space: oracle-cloud-ip-exchange
    zones:
    - default
```

Typing `juju spaces` will list the exchange:

```no-highlight
Space                     Subnets
oracle-cloud-ip-exchange  192.168.0.0/16
```

See [How to configure more complex networks using spaces][spaces] for further
details on networks and spaces.

## Create the Juju controller

You are now ready to create a Juju controller:

Below, we continue with the trial account cloud:

```bash
juju bootstrap oracle-cloud oracle-cloud-controller
```

Above, the name given to the new controller was 'oracle-cloud-controller'.
Oracle Compute will create an instance to run the controller on.

Once created, you can view the controller as an Oracle Compute instance by
navigating to 'My Services URL', opening the left menu (top-left icon), and
selecting 'Compute'. The controller should be visible under the 'Instances'
tab:

![List controller instance](../media/oracle_bootstrap-instances-2.png)

Oracle Compute has the notion of *sites* (like availability zone or region).
You may need to change your site to see your new controller. This is done in
the top-right corner:

![Oracle Compute sites](../media/oracle_bootstrap-instances-sites.png)

## Next steps

You can now start deploying Juju charms and/or bundles to your Oracle cloud.
Continue with Juju by visiting the [Models][models] and
[Introduction to Juju Charms][charms] pages.
