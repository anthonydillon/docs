# Using LXD as a cloud

LXD provides a fast, powerful, self-contained and largely configuration-free
way to experiment with Juju. Using lightweight LXC containers as instances,
even a moderately powerful laptop can create useful models, or serve as
a development platform for your own charms.


## Prerequisites

Juju's support for LXD currently works only with Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial).

Install LXD:

```bash
sudo apt install lxd
newgrp lxd
```

## Alternate backing file-system

LXD can optionally use an alternative file-system for containers. We recommend
using ZFS for the best experience. To use ZFS with LXD enter these commands:

```bash
sudo apt install zfsutils-linux
sudo mkdir /var/lib/zfs
sudo truncate -s 32G /var/lib/zfs/lxd.img
sudo zpool create lxd /var/lib/zfs/lxd.img
sudo lxd init --auto --storage-backend zfs --storage-pool lxd
```

Above we allocated 32GB of space to a sparse file. Consider using a fast block
device if available.


## Create a controller (bootstrap)

It is time to create the controller for LXD. Below, we call it 'lxd-xenial':

```bash
juju bootstrap lxd lxd-test
```

This will result in the controller being visible with the LXC client:

```bash
lxc list
```

```no-highlight
+---------------+---------+-----------------------+------+------------+-----------+
|     NAME      |  STATE  |         IPV4          | IPV6 |    TYPE    | SNAPSHOTS |
+---------------+---------+-----------------------+------+------------+-----------+
| juju-669cb0-0 | RUNNING | 10.154.173.181 (eth0) |      | PERSISTENT | 0         |
+---------------+---------+-----------------------+------+------------+-----------+
```

See more examples of [Creating a controller][bootstrap].

## Next steps

A controller is created with two models - the 'controller' model which
should be reserved for Juju's operations, and a model named 'default'
for deploying user workloads.

## Additional information about LXD

### LXD and images

LXD is image based: all LXD containers come from images and any LXD daemon
instance (also called a "remote") can serve images. When LXD is installed a
locally-running remote is provided (Unix domain socket) and the client is
configured to talk to it (named 'local'). The client is also configured to talk
to several other, non-local, ones (named 'ubuntu', 'ubuntu-daily', and
'images').

An image is identified by its fingerprint (SHA-256 hash), and can be tagged
with multiple aliases. Juju looks for images with aliases in the format
ubuntu-&lt;codename&gt;, for instance 'ubuntu-trusty' or 'ubuntu-xenial'.

For any image-related command, an image is specified by its alias or by its
fingerprint. Both are shown in image lists. An image's filename is its *full
fingerprint* while an image list displays its *partial fingerprint*. Either
type of fingerprint can be used to refer to images.

Juju pulls official cloud images from the 'ubuntu' remote
(http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com) and creates the necessary alias. Any
subsequent requests will be satisfied by the LXD cache (`/var/lib/lxd/images`).
Cached images can be seen with `lxc image list`:


![lxc image list after importing](../media/image_list-imported_image-reduced70.png)

Image cache expiration and image synchronization mechanisms are built-in.

### Remote user credentials

When working with remote users on different machines (see [Creating
users][users] for details on adding users, registering them and granting them
permissions), LXD-hosted controllers need to generate a specific certificate
credential which is shared with the remote machine.

To do this, first run `juju autoload-credentials` on the LXD host. This
will generate output similar to the following:

```bash
Looking for cloud and credential information locally...

1. LXD credential "localhost" (new)
Select a credential to save by number, or type Q to quit:
```

Select the LXD credential (`1` in the above example) and you will be asked for
the name of a cloud to link to this credential. Enter 'localhost' to specify
the local LXD deployment. When the prompt re-appears, type 'q' to quit. The new
certificate credential will have been created.

To export this certificate credential to a file called
`localhost-credentials.yaml`, type the following:

```bash
juju credentials localhost --format=yaml > localhost-credentials.yaml
```

The output file now needs to be moved to the machine and account that requires
access to the local LXD deployment. With this file on the remote machine, the
certificate credential can be imported with the following command:

```bash
juju add-credential localhost -f localhost-credentials.yaml
```
See [Cloud credentials][credentials] for more details on how credentials are used.

### Logs

LXD itself logs to `/var/log/lxd/lxd.log` and Juju machines created via the
LXD local provider log to `/var/log/lxd/juju-{uuid}-machine-{#}`. However,
the standard way to view logs is with the `juju debug-log` command. See
[Viewing logs][logs] for more details.

<!---
Including this table is confusing and not really appropriate for Juju docs.
Still, it's such a nice table that I could not delete it. (pmatulis)

## Useful client commands

There are many client commands available. Some common ones, including those covered
above, are given below.
